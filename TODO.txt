[*] Add icon file for project
[ ] Add readme
[*] Add plugin descriptor tags

[*] Add interface widgets
Hidden items field on https://github.com/runelite/runelite/blob/master/runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/grounditems/GroundItemsConfig.java as an example
  [ ] How do we ensure the value gets truncated on update? Any way to overwrite the setter method? Just define it manually?
  [*] If we can't create a button, how do we get an update when the value is changed? See https://github.com/runelite/runelite/blob/master/runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/grounditems/GroundItemsPlugin.java#L215
[*] Create functions to read and write to Redis
--write: on login, every so often, when config updates
--read: when examine menu option clicked
[*] Timer to periodically refresh value in Redis
[*] Handle client state transitions -- logging in and out, etc
[*] Update value in Redis on value change in widget
[*] Add menu options on players to examine

Be sure to
[*] Truncate values before sending to API
[*] Error handling for when a player's text is absent or fails
[*] Remove example stuff

Caveats
--will not scale well with current expiration time of 2 minutes
--piggybacking off of existing Slayer endpoint which isn't great
--Caching of slayer tasks on API side means that changes to examine text won't be reflected for 2 minutes
--Slayer endpoint: validation requires only alphanum, single quote, space, hyphen
--Slayer endpoint: max length is 50
