# Examine Player
A plugin for the Runelite client that allows players to set customizable examine text, and to examine other players.

### Usage
After installing the plugin from the Plugin Hub, enable the plugin and set your character's examine text.
The examine text will be synced automatically, and other players using the plugin will be able to examine your player
and see it.

### Caveats
The examine text can only be up to 50 characters long, and may only contain letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens and commas.

Due to caching inside Runelite, it may take up to 2 minutes after changing your examine text for the updated text to
become available to other players.
